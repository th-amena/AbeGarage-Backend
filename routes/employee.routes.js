// Use validation middleware in the registration route
// Route Path: The path /employee is defined as a POST route, meaning it will handle employee registration requests that contain data (e.g., in JSON format).
// Middleware (validateEmployeeRegistration): Runs first and validates the request data to ensure it meets requirements (e.g., required fields, correct formats). If validation fails, it returns an error response; if it succeeds, the request is passed on.
// Controller (employeeController.registerEmployee): Executes the registration logic, including saving the new employee to the database. This method handles the main business logic after validation.
